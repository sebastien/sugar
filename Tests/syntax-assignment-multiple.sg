# # Multiple assignations
# # Meaning that 'd' is composed of three elements a,b,c
# var a, b, c = d
# var a:int, b:int, c:int = d
#
# # Meaning that we assign the d[0] to head and d[1:] to tail
# var head | tail = d
#
# # We assign d[0] to a, d[1] to b and d[2:] to tail
# var a:Int, b:Int | tail:Int = d
#
# # We assign an expression, making sure it is not repeated
# var a, b, c = [0,1,2,3]
# var a:int, b:int, c:int = [0,1,2,3,4]
var head | tail = [0,1,2,3,4]
