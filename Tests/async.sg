	#  POSSIBLE SYNTAXES:
	#  @invocation()     (Io-like)
	#  invocation@()
	#  invocation->()    (Narrative JS)
	#  invocation...()
	#  invocation^()
	#  invocation%()
	#  \invocation()
	#  invocation()...
	#  &invocation()
	#  invocation&()
	#  invocation()&

	# The function...params notation visually indicates that the computation
	# will take some time, and evokes the range 0..2 notation, implying that
	# the execution may be broken into sub-parts. The disadvantage is that this
	# notation may be a bit long
	future := compute...()

	# The use of \ indicates escaping, but may be useful for other language
	# features such as lazy arguments passing like f(\a, \b, \c) would mean
	# passing the expressions of a, b, c.
	# future := \compute()

	# The future value is lazily evaluated. When the future is passed, it is not
	# evaluated, but when it is used, it will be evaluated, and will then block
	# the process waiting for the value
	print (future)

	# 
	var cont = continuation..()
	cont :: { e | print e }
